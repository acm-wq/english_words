Ensure that the verb agrees with the subject in both number and person.

## Present Simple Rules

These rules apply only to the third person singular (he, she, it):

- If the verb ends in -ss (pass), -zz (buzz), -x (fix), -sh (wash), -ch (teach), -tch (match), -o (go), add -es to the verb: passes, buzzes, fixes, washes, teaches, goes, matches.
- If the verb ends in -y preceded by a vowel (play), simply add -s: plays.
- If the verb ends in -y preceded by a consonant (cry), change the -y to -i and add -es: cries.

## Past Simple Rules

- For most verbs, add -ed to the base form of the verb: walk -> walked.
- If the verb ends in -e, add -d: love -> loved.
- If the verb ends in a consonant + y, change the -y to -i and add -ed: carry -> carried.
- For one-syllable verbs ending in a single vowel followed by a single consonant, double the consonant and add -ed: stop -> stopped.
- Irregular verbs have unique past tense forms that must be memorized: go -> went, see -> saw.
