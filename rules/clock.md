# Rules for Telling Time in English

## 1. Basic Structure
- Time is usually given in the format: **hour + minutes**.
  - Example: *3:15* → "Three fifteen."
  - Example: *10:30* → "Ten thirty."

## 2. Using "Past" and "To"
- For minutes **before** the half-hour, use **past**.
  - Example: *3:10* → "Ten past three."
  - Example: *7:25* → "Twenty-five past seven."
- For minutes **after** the half-hour, use **to**.
  - Example: *3:50* → "Ten to four."
  - Example: *7:40* → "Twenty to eight."

## 3. Special Cases
- **15 minutes past the hour** → "Quarter past"
  - Example: *5:15* → "Quarter past five."
- **15 minutes before the next hour** → "Quarter to"
  - Example: *5:45* → "Quarter to six."
- **30 minutes past the hour** → "Half past"
  - Example: *6:30* → "Half past six."

## 4. Using AM and PM
- **AM** (Ante Meridiem) = Morning (00:00 - 11:59)
  - Example: *9:00 AM* → "Nine o'clock in the morning."
- **PM** (Post Meridiem) = Afternoon & Evening (12:00 - 23:59)
  - Example: *9:00 PM* → "Nine o'clock in the evening."

## 5. Saying Full Hours
- When it’s exactly on the hour, say **o’clock**.
  - Example: *4:00* → "Four o’clock."
  - Example: *11:00* → "Eleven o’clock."

## 6. Digital and Informal Time
- People often say time informally in a digital style:
  - Example: *10:05* → "Ten oh five."
  - Example: *04:08* → "Four oh eight."
  - Example: *12:20* → "Twelve twenty."

## 7. 24-Hour Clock (Military Time)
- Used in official schedules (transport, military, etc.).
  - Example: *15:00* → "Fifteen hundred hours" or "Three PM."
  - Example: *07:45* → "Seven forty-five AM."
  - Example: *00:00* → "Midnight."
  - Example: *12:00* → "Noon."
